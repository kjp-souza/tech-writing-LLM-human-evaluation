{"question": "What is the difference between Specialized Networks (slices) and Quality-of-service-on-Demand sessions? If there is no difference, just say they are the same thing, but if there is a difference, explain it.", "answer": "Specialized Networks (slices) and Quality-of-Service on Demand (QoD) sessions serve different purposes in managing network resources.  Specialized Networks (slices) refer to logically isolated and customized parts of the mobile network infrastructure for specific use cases or devices. They provide advanced capabilities like:  1. Customized bandwidth and latency 2. Improved security and privacy 3. Better QoE (quality of experience) 4. Enhanced location-based services 5. Network slicing with multiple levels of granularity  On the other hand, Quality-of-Service-on-Demand sessions allow for dynamic control of bandwidth and latency on demand for individual devices or use cases without requiring predefined configurations in a slice. They can be helpful when there is no existing slice for a specific use case but still require some level of network control.  In summary, Specialized Networks (slices) provide advanced capabilities for managing specific use cases or devices with customized network resources, while Quality-of-Service-on-Demand sessions allow for dynamic management of network resources on demand for individual devices or use cases within an existing slice or without it.", "ground_truth_answers": "# Specialized Networks  Network as Code offers easy-to-use SDKs to control Specialized Networks and adapt the 5G network to a myriad of use cases. With Specialized Networks, you can ensure the logical separation and efficient use of network resources according to your current demand.  Think of a Slice (or specialized network) as a customizable part of a much larger network. Now, imagine you can change this specialized portion to meet the needs of each specific use-case. Let's say, when you need reliable connection for your business, streaming, gaming event or the endless possibilities a slice can be created for. Any time you need, at your own demand, a slice can be created to offer tailored network flexibility, speeds and capacities to suit different needs.  Behind this technology, there is a lot of complexity that our SDK code abstracts for you. Like the partitioning of the network infrastructure, which enables the creation of different virtual network instances. The Specialized Networks SDK makes the link between the Network Operator and different devices or applications. So, you can allocate network resources to a given slice or unique QoD session that will guarantee network performance. While also being able to associate specific devices or applications with a particular network slice.  # Quality-of-service on Demand (QoD)  The QoD feature allows establishing prioritized connections between your mobile device and another device or service on the internet.  It allows you to manage the amount of stable bandwidth (connection speed) and the latency (message delay) of network connections for each device, according to your current demand. This prioritized connection flow is established through what we call \"QoD sessions\".  ## What is Quality of Service (QoS)?  This is the technology underpinning QoD. Oftentimes, predictable network performance can be difficult to achieve when there's heavy network traffic, over wide area network (WAN) connections, especially for applications or devices that will require a lot from the network. QoS is then used to manage and prioritize the flow of data over a network.  For instance, when prioritizing critical services like Voice over IP (VoIP), video streaming or latency-sensitive applications, it is important to ensure that different traffic types receive preferential or specific treatment, according to demand. So, by managing bandwidth, latency and balancing the network, QoS empowers a more consistent and reliable user experience! "}
{"question": "How can I find out the device ID of an enterprise-owned drone?", "answer": "To identify a specific device in Network as Code, such as an enterprise-owned drone, you have several options. Here are some ways to do it:  1. **Device IP address:** If the drone is connected to the internet and has a unique public or private IP address, you can use that to identify it. In this case, you would need to specify both the public IP address (if available) and the private IP address or port number (if behind a NAT).     ```python    from network_as_code.models import DeviceIpv4Addr     device = client.devices.get(DeviceIpv4Addr(ip_address=\"192.168.0.1\", port=80))    ```  2. **External ID:** If the drone has an assigned external identifier (e.g., `drone@example.com`), you can use that as well. In this case, simply pass the email address to the `get()` method.     ```python    device = client.devices.get(\"drone@example.com\")    ```  3. **Device identification:** If the drone has a specific device identifier associated with it, you can use that too. For example, if it's an IMEI number, you can use the `imei` parameter:     ```python    device = client.devices.get(imei=\"123456789012345\")    ```  To get started with identifying devices and managing their Quality-of-Service (QoD) sessions using the Network as Code SDK, you'll first need to:  * Install the `network-as-code` Python package. * Set up your API credentials. * Create a new Network as Code client instance.  Then, follow the steps outlined in this tutorial:  1. Identify the drone using one of the methods above (e.g., IP address or external ID). 2. Use the `create_session()` method on the identified drone's `Device` object to create a new Quality-of-Service on Demand (QoD) session. 3. Finally, you can use the provided examples in this tutorial to get all sessions, retrieve specific sessions by their indices or IDs, and manage their properties.", "ground_truth_answers": "That is why the Device ID (also referred to as External Identifier or Network Access Identifier, e.g.: `device@testcsp.net`) can work as an alternate.  In Business to Business (B2B) scenarios, the enterprise owns mobile subscriptions for the devices, and they obtain it from the Network Operator. So, they would know their Device IDs. Enterprises should provide the Device ID related information so that their applications can use them to identify the devices on the mobile network. "}
{"question": "Can you provide an example of attaching a device to a slice using an SDK?", "answer": "Sure! Here's an example using the Python SDK for Network as Code to attach a device to an existing network slice:  ```python from network_as_code.client import NetworkAsCodeClient from network_as_code.models.slice import Slice, SliceDeviceAttachment  client = nac.NetworkAsCodeClient(...)  # Replace these variables with your own values slice_name = \"my-existing-slice\" device_ip = DeviceIpv4Addr(address=\"192.168.0.1\", port=5000) slice = client.slices.get(slice_name)  # Attach the device to the slice attachment = SliceDeviceAttachment(     device=device_ip,     slice=Slice(identifier=slice.identifiers[0]) ) result = client.slicing.attach_device_to_slice(attachment)  print(\"Device attachment result:\", result) ```  In this example, replace `my-existing-slice` with the name of your existing network slice and `192.168.0.1:5000` with the IP address and port number of the device you want to attach.  Make sure that the device is reachable through the network for this operation to succeed. The provided example uses a static IPv4 address and port, but you can adapt it for other types of devices or dynamic IP addresses if needed.", "ground_truth_answers": "## Attaching a device to a slice  Device attachment presupposes a slice already exists and that it is active.

{"question": "What are the ways I can get a device's IPv4 or IPv6 addresses in B2B scenarios?", "answer": "In Business-to-Business (B2B) scenarios, enterprises typically own the mobile subscriptions for devices. They can obtain the Device ID (also known as External Identifier or Network Access Identifier, such as `device@testcsp.net`) from their Network Operator. This Device ID can be used to identify the device on the mobile network.  In scenarios where an IoT device doesn't have a phone number, you will need to find other ways to identify it. IP addresses are dynamic and difficult to identify in advance. To address this challenge, whoever owns the IoT device must implement a way for it to tell its current IP address(es) to a control center or an application.  For creating a Quality of Delivery (QoD) session object with service IPv4 addresses, you can use the following syntax:  ```python session = device.create_qod_session(     \"DOWNLINK_L_UPLINK_L\",  # QoS profile     \"service_ipv4_address\",  # service identified by application IPv4 address and port (optionally)     3600                   # duration in seconds ) ```  If you don't want to pass the parameters by name, you must inform the IP address(es) after the QoS profile. The duration is given in seconds with a default value and an upper limit of 24 hours. For example:  ```python session = device.create_qod_session(     \"DOWNLINK_L_UPLINK_L\",     \"192.0.2.25\",     3600 ) ```  In summary, in B2B scenarios, enterprises can use the Device ID provided by their Network Operator to identify devices on the mobile network.

Application attachment enables fine-grained slice control with different connectivity parameters set for different applications on a device.  **What does this mean?** When you [create](/docs/slicing/slice-creation) a network slice with specific connectivity parameters, such as different amounts of bandwidth a device or slice can get, area of service, etc., you can make sure that only specific applications can access these resources.  This is done by attaching both the device and applications to the slice you just created. Then, when you are done, you can detach them in the same way.  For example, if an enterprise is authorized to use a device and create network slices for it, they can also attach specific applications to them. This way, they can prioritize network resources according to their multiple business applications.  > **NOTE:** Before attaching an enterprise app into a slice, > make sure the enterprise has the right consent to access the device and create specialized network (slices) for it. > Learn how to do it in our [Consent & Identity management policy](/docs/general-concepts/consent-identity-mgmt).  ## Attaching an application to a slice  If you have already [created](/docs/slicing/slice-creation) and [activated](/docs/slicing/slice-activate-deactivate#activating-a-slice) a slice, you can just attach a specific application to it by following this SDK example:  ```python from network_as_code.client import NetworkAsCodeClient from network_as_code.models.device import Device, DeviceIpv4Addr  from network_as_code.models.slice import (     Apps,     Point,     AreaOfService,     NetworkIdentifier,     Slice,     SliceInfo,     Throughput,     TrafficCategories ) ... # The slice needs to be created and activated my_slice.activate()  attachment = my_slice.attach(     device,     # Use HTTPS to send notifications     # about slice attachments.     notification_url=\"https://notify.me/here\",     notification_auth_token=\"replace-with-your-auth-token\",     traffic_categories=TrafficCategories(         apps=Apps(             # This is the OS ID used by Android             os=\"97a498e3-fc92-5c94-8986-0333d06e4e47\",             apps=[\"ENTERPRISE\", \"ENTERPRISE2\"]         )     ) ) ```  ### What's behind this technology?  There's a set of rules, which will enable the User Equipment (UE) to know how to route the traffic to specific applications within the network environment. On the network side, Network as Code will configure these UE Route Selection Policy (URSP) rules according to the Operating System Identifier (OSId) and OS specific Application Identifier (OsAppId) to establish the traffic categories. So, all you will need to provide is the `OSId`, according to the OS you use (Android, iOS, etc.) and the `OsAppId` (Enterprise app name).  For example, [Android's 5G Network Slicing documentation](https://source.android.com/docs/core/connect/5g-slicing) defines their `OSId` with a 5 (UUID) sequence, which is `97a498e3-fc92-5c94-8986-0333d06e4e47`. You can also refer to the [iOS documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/entitlements/com_apple_developer_networking_slicing_trafficcategory) for further information on their `OSId`. Now, for the `OsAppId`, you will need to pass the enterprise app name.  ## Detaching an application from a slice  You can follow the complete steps on how to [detach a device from a slice](/docs/slicing/attach-detach#detaching-a-device-from-a-slice), since it also works for application attachments. Briefly, here is a snippet which summarizes the process of detaching and deleting an application:  ```python # Detach a device my_slice.detach(device)  # Delete an attachment by calling the method # on the attachment previously created attachment.delete()  # Deactivate and delete a slice my_slice.deactivate() my_slice.delete() ```  ### Attachment parameters  The attach/detachment methods have the following parameters:  `traffic_categories` is an optional parameter in the format \"[OS]/[Category]\", which is converted by NaC backend into an OSId and OSAppId according to URSP rules. If this parameter is omitted, the slice will be attached as a default for the device. Otherwise, the slice will be only used for the mentioned traffic categories.  |      **Parameters**       | **Description**                                                                                                                 | | :-----------------------: | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | |         `device`          | Device ID callback parameter used to perform attachment/detachment                                                              | |   `traffic_categories`    | (Optional) It should contain the `OSId`, according to the OS you use (Android, iOS, etc.) and the `OsAppId` (Enterprise app name) | |          `apps`           | The enterprise app name (ID)                                                                                                    | |           `os`            | The **OSId** identifier according to the OS you use (Android, iOS, etc.)                                                        | |    `notification_url`     | (Optional) The recipient's `HTTP` endpoint, which is a web server configured to receive `POST` requests.                        | | `notification_auth_token` | The password used to identify the sender of the notification.                                                                   | |           `id`            | It's possible to define an identifier for the attachment and use it to get the resource.                                        |"}

Before using this code snippet, you'll need to obtain a NaC client instance and get the name or identifier of the slice you intend to update.  Here are the steps to follow:  1. Set up your development environment by installing the required packages (Network as Code SDK and FastAPI). 2. Obtain an access token for making API calls. Use it in the request header as shown below:  ```python import os from fastapi import Header, HTTPException  authorization = \"Bearer my-token\" ```  Replace `my-token` with a valid access token that you have obtained for your NaC account.  3. Initialize the FastAPI application, create necessary models and instances:  ```python from fastapi import FastAPI, Header import network_as_code as nac from network_as_code.models.slice import (Point, AreaOfService, NetworkIdentifier, Slice, SliceInfo, Throughput)  client = nac.NetworkAsCodeClient(...) ```  Replace the `...` with the initialization of your NaC client instance as per the documentation.  4. Get the slice you want to modify:  ```python slice = client.slices.get(\"slice-name_1\")  # Replace \"slice-name_1\" with the name or identifier of your existing slice. ```  5. Modify the desired parameters:  ```python slice.modify(max_data_connections=12, max_devices=3,              slice_downlink_throughput=Throughput(guaranteed=10, maximum=10),              slice_uplink_throughput=Throughput(guaranteed=10, maximum=10),              device_downlink_throughput=Throughput(guaranteed=10, maximum=10),              device_uplink_throughput=Throughput(guaranteed=10, maximum=10)) ```  Replace the values within the `modify()` method with the desired parameters and their respective new values.  **Parameters:**  | Parameters                   | Description                                             | |------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------| | max_data_connections          | Maximum number of data connections for this slice       | | max_devices                  | Maximum number of devices in this slice              | | slice_downlink_throughput     | The downlink throughput for the entire slice           | | slice_uplink_throughput        | The uplink throughput for the entire slice             | | device_downlink_throughput    | The downlink throughput for devices in this slice      | | device_uplink_throughput       | The uplink throughput for devices in this slice        |  Replace the values within the `Throughput` class to set the desired guaranteed and maximum throughput (in Mbps) for both downlink and uplink.

The provided code snippet consists of three main parts:  1. **Slice creation:** Here, we create a new slice with optional parameters, such as geographic location, service type, and differentiator. 2. **Activating the slice:** After creating a slice, it's important to activate it before it can be used for device attachment. 3. **Attaching the slice to a device:** In the last step, we attach the activated slice to a specific device using its unique identifier (IPv4 address).  ## Background Information  Network slicing is a technology that enables operators to provide multiple, independent end-to-end communication services over a common shared physical infrastructure. The `NetworkAsCode` Python SDK allows you to create and manage  network slices for your applications and devices easily.  To get started with this example, first make sure you have the following prerequisites:  * Install [Python 3.x](https://www.python.org/downloads/) on your system. * Set up an account on the Network as Code platform ([register here](https://platform.networkascode.com/register)). * Configure and initialize your `NetworkAsCodeClient` with proper credentials, e.g., API key and secret [here](/docs/getting-started/client).  > **TIP:** You can read more about the slicing terminology (e.g.: Network ID, slice type/info) on the [Network Slicing index page](/docs/slicing/index-slc).  ## Slice creation parameters  ```python from network_as_code.client import NetworkAsCodeClient from network_as_code.models.device import Device, DeviceIpv4Addr from network_as_code.models.slice import (Point, AreaOfService, NetworkIdentifier, Slice, SliceInfo)  my_slice = client.slices.create(     # Define slice properties here if needed     name=\"MyAppSlice\",     area_of_service=AreaOfService(latitude=52.3791, longitude=13.2406),     network_identifier=NetworkIdentifier(         service_type=\"ENTERPRISE_GAMING\",         slice_differentiator=\"MyAppSlice\",     ), ) ```  | Parameters                          | Description                                                                                                       | |-------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------| | `name`                              | The unique name of the new slice.                                                                                | | `area_of_service`                    | Geographic location of the area where the slice is expected to be available, defined using latitude and longitude.  | | `network_identifier`                | Identifies the network slice's service type and differentiator for the application.                             |  ## Activating a Slice  ```python my_slice.activate() ```  Activate the created slice to make it operational before attaching it to a device.  ## Attaching a Slice to a Device  ```python device = client.devices.get(\"192.168.0.1\")  # Replace this with your target device IPv4 address. my_slice.attach(device, traffic_categories=TrafficCategories(apps=[ENTERPRISE, ENTERPRISE2])) ```  | Parameters                          | Description                                                                                                                            | |-------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------| | `device`                            | The unique identifier (IPv4 address) of the target device to attach the slice.                                                        | | `traffic_categories`                | An optional argument that sets traffic categories for the specified apps in the attached slice.                             |  For more information on how to fill in the details, consult the following documentation:  * [Device](/docs/models/device) * [Slice](/docs/models/slice) * [Traffic Categories](/docs/concepts/traffic-categories) * [Apps](/docs/concepts/applications) * [OS](/docs/concepts/os)", "ground_truth_answers": "--- tags: application attachment, network slice application attachment, specialized network application attachment desc: Learn how to attach or detach an application from a Network as Code slice ---  # Attaching and detaching applications  Besides [attaching](/docs/slicing/attach-detach) a device to a network slice as whole, you can attach specific applications instead. Application attachment enables fine-grained slice control with different connectivity parameters set for different applications on a device.  **What does this mean?** When you [create](/docs/slicing/slice-creation) a network slice with specific connectivity parameters, such as different amounts of bandwidth a device or slice can get, area of service, etc., you can make sure that only specific applications can access these resources.  This is done by attaching both the device and applications to the slice you just created. Then, when you are done, you can detach them in the same way.  For example, if an enterprise is authorized to use a device and create network slices for it, they can also attach specific applications to them. This way, they can prioritize network resources according to their multiple business applications.  > **NOTE:** Before attaching an enterprise app into a slice, > make sure the enterprise has the right consent to access the device and create specialized network (slices) for it. > Learn how to do it in our [Consent & Identity management policy](/docs/general-concepts/consent-identity-mgmt).  ## Attaching an application to a slice  If you have already [created](/docs/slicing/slice-creation) and [activated](/docs/slicing/slice-activate-deactivate#activating-a-slice) a slice, you can just attach a specific application to it by following this SDK example:  ```python from network_as_code.client import NetworkAsCodeClient from network_as_code.models.device import Device, DeviceIpv4Addr  from network_as_code.models.slice import (     Apps,     Point,     AreaOfService,     NetworkIdentifier,     Slice,     SliceInfo,     Throughput,     TrafficCategories ) ... # The slice needs to be created and activated my_slice.activate()  attachment = my_slice.attach(     device,     # Use HTTPS to send notifications     # about slice attachments.     notification_url=\"https://notify.me/here\",     notification_auth_token=\"replace-with-your-auth-token\",     traffic_categories=TrafficCategories(         apps=Apps(             # This is the OS ID used by Android             os=\"97a498e3-fc92-5c94-8986-0333d06e4e47\",             apps=[\"ENTERPRISE\", \"ENTERPRISE2\"]         )     ) ) ```  ### What's behind this technology?  There's a set of rules, which will enable the User Equipment (UE) to know how to route the traffic to specific applications within the network environment. On the network side, Network as Code will configure these UE Route Selection Policy (URSP) rules according to the Operating System Identifier (OSId) and OS specific Application Identifier (OsAppId) to establish the traffic categories. So, all you will need to provide is the `OSId`, according to the OS you use (Android, iOS, etc.) and the `OsAppId` (Enterprise app name).  For example, [Android's 5G Network Slicing documentation](https://source.android.com/docs/core/connect/5g-slicing) defines their `OSId` with a 5 (UUID) sequence, which is `97a498e3-fc92-5c94-8986-0333d06e4e47`. You can also refer to the [iOS documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/entitlements/com_apple_developer_networking_slicing_trafficcategory) for further information on their `OSId`. Now, for the `OsAppId`, you will need to pass the enterprise app name.  ## Detaching an application from a slice  You can follow the complete steps on how to [detach a device from a slice](/docs/slicing/attach-detach#detaching-a-device-from-a-slice), since it also works for application attachments. Briefly, here is a snippet which summarizes the process of detaching and deleting an application:  ```python # Detach a device my_slice.detach(device)  # Delete an attachment by calling the method # on the attachment previously created attachment.delete()  # Deactivate and delete a slice my_slice.deactivate() my_slice.delete() ```  ### Attachment parameters  The attach/detachment methods have the following parameters:  `traffic_categories` is an optional parameter in the format \"[OS]/[Category]\", which is converted by NaC backend into an OSId and OSAppId according to URSP rules. If this parameter is omitted, the slice will be attached as a default for the device. Otherwise, the slice will be only used for the mentioned traffic categories.  |      **Parameters**       | **Description**                                                                                                                 | | :-----------------------: | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | |         `device`          | Device ID callback parameter used to perform attachment/detachment                                                              | |   `traffic_categories`    | (Optional) It should contain the `OSId`, according to the OS you use (Android, iOS, etc.) and the `OsAppId` (Enterprise app name) | |          `apps`           | The enterprise app name (ID)                                                                                                    | |           `os`            | The **OSId** identifier according to the OS you use (Android, iOS, etc.)                                                        | |    `notification_url`     | (Optional) The recipient's `HTTP` endpoint, which is a web server configured to receive `POST` requests.                        | | `notification_auth_token` | The password used to identify the sender of the notification.                                                                   | |           `id`            | It's possible to define an identifier for the attachment and use it to get the resource.                                        |"}

In particular, it demonstrates how to retrieve a network slice object, modify its parameters, such as the number of data connections and throughput, and reapply those changes. Furthermore, it touches upon concepts like the NetworkAsCode package and the SliceInfo and Throughput classes.  Firstly, let's clarify some basic background information regarding network slices and the NetworkAsCode package:  A network slice is a logical separation of a network for traffic management, resource allocation, and security purposes. It defines a specific portion of a physical or virtual network and can include multiple interconnected subnets. In turn, it can represent different types of services, such as VoIP, video streaming, or FTP.  The NetworkAsCode package is a comprehensive library for handling IP addresses, routing protocols, subnet masks, and other related networking concepts. It comes in handy when creating complex network scenarios or dealing with large-scale network infrastructure.  Now, let's dive deeper into the provided code snippet:  ```vbnet 'imports the required packages and classes from NetworkAsCode using namespace network_as_code;  'creates a new instance of the NetworkAsCodeClient dim MyNetworkingApp = new Application(); MyNetworkingApp.InitializeWiseDmc();  'retrieves a specific network slice using its name Dim mySlice = MyNetworkingApp.Network.GetSlices().Find(\"slice-name-1\");  'modifies the given slice parameters, if needed mySlice.UpdateDataConnections(12); mySlice.UpdateThroughputs(10, 10, 10, 10); //guaranteed and maximum mySlice.ApplyChanges(); ```  In this example, we begin by importing the required packages and classes from NetworkAsCode:  ```vbnet using namespace network_as_code; ```  Next, we create a new instance of the `NetworkAsCodeClient`, initializing WiseDmc for it:  ```vbnet dim MyNetworkingApp = new Application(); MyNetworkingApp.InitializeWiseDmc(); ```  With the NetworkAsCodeClient established, we proceed to retrieve a specific network slice using its name:  ```vbnet Dim mySlice = MyNetworkingApp.Network.GetSlices().Find(\"slice-name-1\"); ```  Now, if desired modifications to the given slice's parameters are needed, follow these steps:  ```vbnet mySlice.UpdateDataConnections(12); //max_data_connections mySlice.UpdateThroughputs(10, 10, 10, 10); //slice_downlink_throughput and slice_uplink_throughput (guaranteed and maximum) mySlice.ApplyChanges(); ```  This sequence of statements first modifies the `max_data_connections` property to `12`, then updates both downlink and uplink throughputs with guaranteed and maximum values, i.e., 10 for both. Lastly, they're applied by calling the `ApplyChanges()` method.  This code snippet demonstrates how to retrieve a network slice object, modify its parameters, and reapply those changes. Additionally, it highlights the importance of the NetworkAsCode package and the SliceInfo and Throughput classes when dealing with complex networking scenarios or handling large-scale network infrastructure.", "ground_truth_answers": "--- tags: network slice modification, slice modification, modifying a specialized network, modifying a slice desc: Learn how to modify a network slice ---  # Modifying slices  You can modify the parameters for an existing slice with the `modify()` method.  ## Modifying a slice  In the following SDK snippet, first we [get](/docs/slicing/get-slice) an existing slice that we need to modify. Next, we modify some slice parameters, such as `slice throughput`, `maximum number of data connections` and `devices`. So, we use the `modify()` method to make these changes. Learn more about the parameters that can be modified [below](/docs/slicing/modify-slices#slice-parameters).  ```python import network_as_code as nac from network_as_code.models.slice import (     Point,     AreaOfService,     NetworkIdentifier,     Slice,     SliceInfo,     Throughput )  client = nac.NetworkAsCodeClient(...)  # Get the slice you want to modify. slice = client.slices.get(\"slice-name_1\")  # Remember to reconfigure all the parameters you wish to modify, # The modify() method does not preserve previously configure ones. slice.modify(     max_data_connections = 12,     max_devices = 3,     slice_downlink_throughput=Throughput(guaranteed=10, maximum=10),     slice_uplink_throughput=Throughput(guaranteed=10, maximum=10),     device_downlink_throughput=Throughput(guaranteed=10, maximum=10),     device_uplink_throughput=Throughput(guaranteed=10, maximum=10) ) ```  ### Slice parameters  These are the slice parameters that can be modified using the `modify()` method and a brief description of them.  |                      **Parameters**                       | **Description**                                          | | :-------------------------------------------------------: | -------------------------------------------------------- | | `slice_uplink_throughput` or `slice_downlink_throughput`  | Specify the amount of bandwidth the slice can get.       | | `device_uplink_throughput` or `device_downlink_throughput` | Specify the amount of bandwidth the device can get.     | |                  `max_data_connections`                   | Maximum number of data connection sessions in the slice. | |                       `max_devices`                       | Maximum number of devices in the slice.                  |  #### What is a notification URL?
